  <h1>Boy, I wish I had a pet...</h1>
  <h5>It would be really nice.</h5>
  <h3>But let's be real for a second. Brian, <em>you're a father of two</em> --one of which who's only <strong>three weeks old</strong>.</h3>
  <p>How do you honestly expect to take care of a pet on top of all that?</p>
  <p>Yeah, Bri, that's what I thought.</p>
  <h2>But of course! You'd like some proof to back that up. Let's take a look at your daily workload:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Spending time with Marla outside in the morning and afternoon.</li>
    <li>Time holding Julian while Laura showers and gets some much needed Me Time.</li>
    <li>Time holding Julian just because <em>you want too and you're his <strong>dad</strong></em>.</li>
    <li>How about time for music and your own Me Time?</li>
    <li>Oh, let's not forget the 5-7 diaper changes per day.</li>
    <li>Oh yeah and Epicodus too...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Yeah a pet would be great. We all know that. But you've got your hands full right now, my guy.</p>
  <p>Let's do the pet thing once things cool down a bit.</p>
